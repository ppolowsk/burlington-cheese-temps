# Introduction
A look at temperatures of cheese and dairy cases around the Burlington, VT area. 

# Methods
An IR thermometer was used to measure the temperature of two seperate products in each cheese case and/or dairy case (depending on store). These two measurments were averaged.

Plots were generated using R and ggplot2.

The temperature displayed on the coolers was also recorded, if available.

About 20 stores were surveyed.

# Results
The results were unsurprising. Some places had cheese that was near room temperature (a big no no), and others had cheese near freezing (not as big of a no no).
